I can see what's happening, what?
And they don't have a clue, who?
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line,
our trio's down to two, oh.

Ze sweet cah-ress of twilight.
There's magic everywhere.
And with all this romantic atmosphere,
disaster's in the air!

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings.

The world, for once, in perfect harmony with all its living things.

So many things to tell her,
but how to make her see?
The truth about my past, impossible.
She'd turn away from me.

He's holding back, he's hiding, but what I can't decide.
Why won't he be the king I know he is, the king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings.

The world, for once, in perfect harmony with all its living things.

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far.

Steering through the night's uncertainties,
Love is where they are.

And if he falls in love tonight,
It can be assumed...

His care-free days with us are history.
In short, our pal is doomed!

Waaah-hoo hoo hoo!
Boo-hoo hoo hoo!
